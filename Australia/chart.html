        <h2><span style='color:#008000'>Overall Income Inequality: </span>Gini coefficient - Equivalised disposable
            household income ★</h2>
        <p><b>What is the source data that the Chartbook relies on? </b>Gini coefficient of equivalised disposable
            weekly household income from the Australian Bureau of Statistics: linked back at 1994 to the LIS series for
            Gini coefficient of equivalised disposable household income. The ABS figures indicate a break in the series
            in 2007 due to a change in methodology that was also partially applied in the 2003–04 and 2005–06 series. It
            notes that "Estimates presented for 2007–08 onwards are not directly comparable with estimates for previous
            cycles due to the improvements made to measuring income introduced in the 2007–08 cycle. Estimates for
            2003–04 and 2005–06 have been recompiled to reflect the new measures of income, however not all components
            introduced in 2007–08 are available for earlier cycles." The comparability of the surveys conducted over the
            decade to 2010 is discussed in more detail by Wilkins (2014), who concludes that due to the changes in
            survey methodology, "it is not possible to produce deﬁnitive estimates of income inequality trends between
            2001 and 2010."</p>

            Hours': linked back at 1998 to series from OECD LMS, which is also presented in Atkinson (2008); data
            relates to full-time workers (all jobs prior to 1988), based on the August household survey 'Weekly Earnings
