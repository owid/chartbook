<h2><span style='color:#008000'>Overall Income Inequality: </span>Gini coefficient - Equivalised gross household income</h2><p><b>What is the source data that the Chartbook relies on? </b>Gini coefficient for gross equivalised household income from the U.S. Census Bureau. Data from 1967 to 2016 is from the 2016 vintage; we assume that half of the recorded change betwen 1992 and 1993 was due to the methodological change, and therefore added 1.15 percentage points to the original values from 1992 back to 1967; we link back in 2013 to account for the new survey design. We link back at 2017 to data from the 2018 vintage to account for changes in the data processing system. More recent data comes from the 2020 vintage, but no link is applied as no methodological changes are indicated.

We link back at 1967 to data related to money income before tax for consumer units (families plus unrelated individuals) from Budd (1970); linked back at 1944 to the BEA synthetic series for gross family incomes, based on calculations from the tabulations in Brandolini (2002); linked back again at 1929 to NBER/Brookings synthetic estimates for gross income of income recipients, based on the tabulations in Mitchell et al (1921) for 1918 and Leven, Moulton and Warburton (1934) for 1929.</p><h4>How does the Chartbook series compare with the source data?</h4>
