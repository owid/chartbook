    <h2>Overall Income Inequality</h2>
    <nvd3 options="options" data="data0"></nvd3>
    <p>Gini coefficient for household equivalised income from SEDLAC. The data are derived from the PNAD household
        survey (replaced from 2016 with the 'Continuous PNAD' or PNADC). Over the period covered, the survey underwent
        several methodological changes; these are indicated within SEDLAC as breaks in the series, but with only very
        limited descriptions: the latest data, from 2016 onwards, is specified as including implicit rent, suggesting
        that this was not included in earlier data, or not included consistently. The data from 2004 is specified as
        including the 'Rural North', again suggesting that earlier figures exclude this region. We construct the final
        series by linking the subseries across these breaks. No figures are available between 1990 and 1993 in the gap
        between the first subseries ending and the second starting; here we link the series by assuming there was no
        intervening change in inequality between 1990 and 1993. For a discussion of the data sources on which SEDLAC is
        based and their limitations, see Gasparini, Cruces & Tornarolli (2011).</p>
    <h2>Top Income Shares</h2>
    <nvd3 options="options" data="data1"></nvd3>
    <nvd3 options="options" data="data2"></nvd3>
    <p>Pre-tax national income share held by top percentile from WID.world. Data relates to individuals over age 20,
        assuming resources are split equally within couples.</p>
    <h2>Poverty</h2>
    <nvd3 options="options" data="data3"></nvd3>
    <p>Gini coefficient for household equivalised income from SEDLAC. The data are derived from the PNAD household
        survey (replaced from 2016 with the 'Continuous PNAD' or PNADC). The data from 2004 is specified as including
        the 'Rural North', suggesting that earlier figures exclude this region.
        Percentage of individuals below 50 per cent of median household per capita income from SEDLAC, linked at 2004 to
        the “New PNAD” data series, linked at 1992 to the earlier “PNAD” series (on the assumption of no change between
        1990 and 1992). No figures are available between 1990 and 1992 in the gap between the first subseries ending and
        the second starting; here we link the series by assuming there was no intervening change in inequality between
        1990 and 1992. Earlier figures from before 1990, available in previous vintages of the dataset, were not
        included in the 2020 release; we extend the series back to 1981 by linking to data taken from the 2018 release
        for this period.</p>
    <h2>Earnings Dispersion</h2>
    <nvd3 options="options" data="data4"></nvd3>
    <p>Gini coefficient for labour earnings in six main metropolitan regions, persons aged 15-60, from Neri (2010).</p>
