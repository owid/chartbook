        <h2 style='color:#008000;'>Overall Income Inequality</h2>
        <h3>Gini coefficient - Equivalised household income</h3>
        <p>Gini coefficient for household equivalised income from SEDLAC. The data are derived from the PNAD household
            survey (replaced from 2016 with the 'Continuous PNAD' or PNADC). Over the period covered, the survey
            underwent several methodological changes; these are indicated within SEDLAC as breaks in the series, but
            with only very limited descriptions: the latest data, from 2016 onwards, is specified as including implicit
            rent, suggesting that this was not included in earlier data, or not included consistently. The data from
            2004 is specified as including the 'Rural North', again suggesting that earlier figures exclude this region.
            We construct the final series by linking the subseries across these breaks. No figures are available between
            1990 and 1993 in the gap between the first subseries ending and the second starting; here we link the series
            by assuming there was no intervening change in inequality between 1990 and 1993. For a discussion of the
            data sources on which SEDLAC is based and their limitations, see Gasparini, Cruces & Tornarolli (2011).</p>

        <h2 style='color:#6a3d9a;'>Top Income Shares</h2>
        <h3>Share of top 1% - Household income (excluding capital gains)</h3>
        <p>Share of top 1 per cent in total income (households, excluding capital gains) for 1960 and 1970 from Langoni
            (1978).</p>

            assuming resources are split equally within couples.</p>

        <p>Percentage of individuals below 50 per cent of median household per capita income from SEDLAC (2020) New PNAD
            household survey data. The data from 2004 are specified as including the 'Rural North', suggesting that
            earlier figures exclude this region; in 2012, the 'Continuous PNAD' or 'New PNADC' series was introduced: we
            link backwards between the series on these dates. Earlier figures from before 1992 were not included in
            SEDLAC (2020); we extend the series back to 1981 by linking to data taken from SEDLAC (2018) for this
            period. No figures are available between 1990 and 1992 in the gap between the first subseries ending and the
            second starting; here we link the series by assuming there was no intervening change in inequality between
            1990 and 1992.</p>
