<h2><span style='color:#008000'>Overall Income Inequality: </span>Gini coefficient - Income (tax units) </h2><p><b>What is the source data that the Chartbook relies on? </b>Gini coefficient of unequivalised after-tax income among tax units (“Blue Book series”) from Atkinson and Micklewright (1992). The figure for 1938 is taken from the Royal Commission on the Distribution of Income and Wealth (1979); no multiplier is applied.</p><h4>How does the Chartbook series compare with the source data?</h4>

A single source series is used, taken from the Institute for Fiscal Studies; the data are based on the Family Expenditure Survey from 1961 up to financial year 1993/4 (calendar years up to 1992), and the Family Resources Survey thereafter.</p><h4>How does the Chartbook series compare with the source data?</h4>

A single source series is used, taken from Institute for Fiscal Studies; the data are based on the Family Expenditure Survey from 1961 up to financial year 1993/4 (calendar years up to 1992), and the Family Resources Survey thereafter.</p><h4>How does the Chartbook series compare with the source data?</h4>

<h2><span style='color:#104E8B'>Earnings Dispersion: </span>Top decile as % median - Gross individual earnings ★</h2><p><b>What is the source data that the Chartbook relies on? </b>Gross individual earnings at top decile as percentage of median for all full-time workers from Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) from 1997 to 2016, linked back in 2011, 2006 and 2004 to account for methodological changes: linked back at 1997 to data from the annual New Earnings Survey (NES) as presented in Atkinson (2008): linked back at 1968 to calculations based on Inland Revenue income tax data (Schedule E earnings) from Atkinson (2008). The source notes, 'There is no reason to expect the distribution generated by the Schedule E data to be the same as that from the NES. NES data relate to the current pay period; the Schedule E data to annual earnings. The coverage differs in terms of both people and earnings.'</p><h4>How does the Chartbook series compare with the source data?</h4>
