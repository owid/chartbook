Finland,1966,31.1,F1,Overall Income Inequality,Gini coefficient,Equivalised disposable household income,,,,*,"Gini coefficient of equivalised disposable household income. A single source series is used, taken from StatFin (2021). The series corresponds to StatFin's disposable cash/money income concept which excludes imputed rent and capital gains (as it notes, the 'cross-nationally comparable concept'). StatFin flags some changes in the underlying data sources – from 1986 and then again from 1995 – and also indicates there was a change in the equivalence scale used from 2002 when it moved to the OECD adjusted (Eurostat) scale. For more details on the construction of this series, see the source's 'Concepts and definitions' page (https://www.stat.fi/til/tjt/kas_en.html).",S2,
